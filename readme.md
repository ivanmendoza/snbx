SNBX (Alpha)
=============

A responsive web design framework with mobile-first approach. 

Think in something useful like Foundation or Bootstrap but with a different approach. No template no boilerplate but a library of styles to make templates and boilerplates. 

The first time that import _snbx.less file you only gets a kind of CSS reset, everything else remains "invisible", that means a css of about 21kb (with grids functionality and compressed, or 7kb without grids). At this time you get nothing to show, but then you can start to create your own template (like Foundation or Bootstrap).
